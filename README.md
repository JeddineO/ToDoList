To-Do List App
This is a simple to-do list application built with React.js and JSON Server. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and searching for tasks based on the title.

Prerequisites
Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js
JSON Server
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd todo-list-app
npm install
Start JSON Server:
css
Copy code
json-server --watch db.json --port 8000
Start the React development server:
sql
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
Usage
Add a new task: Enter the task description in the "New task..." input field and click the "Add" button. The task will be added to the to-do list.
Mark a task as completed: Click on the checkbox next to the task title. The task will be marked as completed and visually indicated.
Delete a task: Click on the delete button (trash icon) next to the task. The task will be deleted from the list.
Search for tasks: Enter a keyword in the search input field to filter the tasks based on the title. The list will update dynamically to display only the tasks that match the search criteria.
Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
JSON Server: A simple and lightweight JSON-based data server.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
